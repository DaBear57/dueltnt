*Season 8 Update*

Goals:
4-year anniversary WHOOOOOOOOOOO!

The season is all about adding in a new character 'Shard'. I hope to return to
form somewhat with this character while also doing something fresh. This character
comes with Duel TNT's first in game event. Explore what has changed in the lobby.

Powerful characters Trapper, Overlord, Mad Scientist, and Echo are getting minor 
changes to add more space for counter-play. Soldier and Ghost are getting changes
to make their gameplay smoother and more consistant.

Assassin, Reaper, and Wizard are getting character reworks to introduce more
depth and options to the kit in areas where gameplay felt very limiting.

Gardener is one again getting pushed to stay in fight, but in its own unique way.

On the less exciting backend, I have cleaned the code, with the
goal to help those trying to modify or learn from the game.
